#' Individual Tree Detection and Segmentation Algorithm
#'
#' This function is made to be used in \link[lidR:find_trees]{find_trees} or \link[lidR:segment_trees]{segment_trees}.
#' It implements the PTrees algorithm for tree detection and tree segmentation based Vega et al. (2014) (see references).
#' When used in the function \link[lidR:find_trees]{find_trees} it runs only the fisrt part of the method i.e. the
#' detection of the trees. When used in  \link[lidR:segment_trees]{segment_trees} it performs the  whole segmentation (see details).
#'
#' This function has been written by the \code{lidR} authors from the original article. We made our
#' best to implement as far as possible exactly what is written in the original paper but we cannot
#' states that it is the exact original algorithm. Also, minor variations were introduced to fix some
#' issues that were not adressed in the original paper:
#' \itemize{
#' \item Addition of the parameter \code{hmin}: to reduce oversegmentation we introduced a minium height
#' threshold. Points below this thresold cannot initiate new trees during the tree detection and cannot
#' incrase a crown hull during the segmentation.
#' \item Addition of the parameter \code{nmax}: in the original article page 103 figures 5, the number
#' of possible combination is 2^n-n-1. This exponential number of combinations lead, in some cases
#' to an infinite computation time. During the developpement we got cases where the number of combinations
#' to consider was beyond a billion. If the number of tree to consider between two scales is greater
#' than \code{nmax} (i.e. the number of combination is greater than 2^nmax-nmax-1) then the "TreeSegment"
#' from the biggest scale is retained anyway, the smallest scale is considered as dummy.
#' }
#' Notice that to use the PTree strictly as originally described, the point cloud should
#' not be normalized (see reference). In that case the parameter '\code{hmin}' is miningless and can
#' be set to \code{-Inf} for example.
#'
#' @param k integer vector. A serie of k-nearest neighbors to use. In this original paper a k refers
#' to a 'scale' of analyse (see reference).
#'
#' @param hmin scalar. This is an addition from the original paper to limit oversegmentation.
#' Point below this threshold cannot initiate new trees or increase a hull (see details). Set to \code{-Inf}
#' to strictly respect original paper.
#'
#' @param nmax integer. This is an addition from the original paper to protect against uncomputable
#' cases (see details). Set to \code{+Inf} to strictly respect the original paper (not recommended)
